# OOP_GroupProject_GrumpyVets
Group Project


A simple **Java-based Chess game** project.  
This is a practice project to learn **object-oriented design**, **game logic**, and later expand to a **graphical interface**.


## Features (Current / Planned)
- Console-based chess board printing  
- Input moves using chess notation (e.g., `e2e4`)  
- Turn-based play (White / Black)  
- Basic move validation (pawn, rook, knight, bishop, queen, king)  
- Capturing pieces 
- Check / Checkmate detection  
- Special moves (castling, en passant, pawn promotion)  
- Graphical version
